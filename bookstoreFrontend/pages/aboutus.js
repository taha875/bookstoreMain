                Welcome to Islamic Books Library, the Authentic Source for
                Authentic Islamic Books!
              </div>
              This Is a Pure Islamic Blog and Publishes English & Urdu Islamic
              Books on Different Topics Time to Time. The Sole Purpose of This
              Blog Is to Spread the Correct Information of Deen in This Day &
              Age of Fitnah. There Are Many Deviant Groups Out There Who Claim
              to Be on the Correct Deen Whereas Some of Them Are Indulged in
              Bid’Aat & Shirk While Others Are Rejecting the Manhaj and Tareeqah
              of Salaf As-Saliheen by Refuting Taqleed of the Four Imams.
              <br />
              <br />
              These Deviant Groups Are Not Only Working Hard to Deviate People
              From Manhaj & Tareeqah of Our Elders Practically but Also Has a
              Very Strong Presence on the Internet, Hence Confusing the Youth of
              Ummah Even More in This Age of Technology.
              <br />
              <br />
              So It Is a Necessity of the Time That More & More Blogs or
              Websites Be Made Available on the Internet So That the Youth of
              the Ummah Has Access to the Correct Knowledge of Deen.
              <br />
              <br />
              Through This Blog Inshallah I Intend to Publish Books of the
              Middle & Correct Path of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah, as Shown to Us
              by Salaf As-Saliheen.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Books Have Been Categorised Under Different Topics for Easy
              Searching. All English Books Have Also Been Collected Under One
              Category Called “English Books” Whereas Urdu Books Are Only
              Categorised Under Their Respective Topics. A Single Book May Be
              Categorised Under Different Topics as Required, but Mostly a
              Single Category Is Used to Prevent Overlapping.
              <br />
              <br />
              15 Latest Posts (Books) Are Shown on the Side Panel as “Latest
              Updates” & 5 Posts Are Shown at a Time on One Page. To Find Older
              Posts Please Click “Older Entries” at the Bottom of Each Page.
              <br />
              <br />
              Video, Audio & Nasheed Sections Are Also Introduced Where
              Different Islamic Stuff Is Uploaded & Updated Regularly. This
              Section Does Not Show Updates at the Main Page Hence Needs to Be
              Checked Manually. The Main Purpose of the Blog Is to Promote
              Islamic Books.
